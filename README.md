Movie Trailers
================

This is a sample project for Udacity's "Programming Foundations" cource, and the Full Stack Web Dev nanodegree.

In this project, I'm making a tool to report basic stats via text output.  The stats in this case, will be based on a postgresql database that has website logs.

Getting Started
---------------

You'll need to have Python installed on your computer. Python 3 is the version this application is developed on. Python 2.7 may work, but isn't the tested version.

You may also need to install some modules via pip

TODO: add modules if needed

Documentation and Support
-------------------------

This is a demo project, and there is planned support. However, you may find support on the [Udacity forums](https://discussions.udacity.com/).

Usage
-----
<!-- 
1. Download and unzip the files in this [zip file](https://github.com/beaukinstler/ud036_StarterCode/archive/master.zip), or clone with `$ git clone git@github.com:beaukinstler/ud036_StarterCode.git`
1. `cd` into the 'ud036_StarterCode' folder.
1. Edit the "entertainment_center.py" file.
    * The movies can be changed in the `make_list_of_movies()` function.
    * NOTE: You must create a Movie() object for each movie that you want to include.
1. Ensure all the movie instances have also been added to the `movies_list` array, if you want them show up on the web page.
1. run the entertainment_center.py file.
    * In most steups, with python installed, you should be able to run this command from the folder with this code
        > `$ python entertainment_center.py`
    * This will run the code, create a `fresh_tomatoes.html` file in the working directory, and launch a web browser to read the file. -->
